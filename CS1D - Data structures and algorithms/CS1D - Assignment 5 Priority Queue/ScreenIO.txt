* Description   :                                                        *
*  This program will start with outputting PART ONE of the assignment    *
*  which is using the UN-SORTED list to complete the emergency room      *
*  Scenario. The output will start with the patient that has been waiting*
*  the longest since before 12(noon). Then it will output the remaining  *
*  in the order they have waited. There will be two life threatening     *
*  Emergencies that will happen throughout the output and will state when*
*  they are occurring. After the emergencies, the remaining time will be *
*  fulfilled to the patient that was left and then will carry on through *
*  the priority queue. After the first implementation of the UN-SORTED   *
*  list, now it will go into the STL priority queue. It will be reusing  *
*  Most of the output but will be using the STL to complete the          *
*  operations.                                                           *
