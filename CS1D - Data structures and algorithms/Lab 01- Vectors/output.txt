Vectors 
This program uses a random number generator to generate 20 three 
digit integers. It will then perform the following operations: 

 	- Sort the random numbers
	- Store the sorted random numbers in a vector
	- Reverse the digits of the of the random numbers
	- Store the reversed digits in another vector
	- Sum the digits of the random numbers
 	- Store the sums in another vector
	- Print all three vectors

The randomized vector is:           687, 126, 994, 797, 469, 663, 611, 182, 850, 193, 400, 694, 520, 310, 106, 237, 781, 710, 196, 749
The sorted vector is:               106, 126, 182, 193, 196, 237, 310, 400, 469, 520, 611, 663, 687, 694, 710, 749, 781, 797, 850, 994
The vector with digits reversed is: 601, 621, 281, 391, 691, 732, 013, 004, 964, 025, 116, 366, 786, 496, 017, 947, 187, 797, 058, 499

The sum of the digits of 106 is 7
The sum of the digits of 126 is 9
The sum of the digits of 182 is 11
The sum of the digits of 193 is 13
The sum of the digits of 196 is 16
The sum of the digits of 237 is 12
The sum of the digits of 310 is 4
The sum of the digits of 400 is 4
The sum of the digits of 469 is 19
The sum of the digits of 520 is 7
The sum of the digits of 611 is 8
The sum of the digits of 663 is 15
The sum of the digits of 687 is 21
The sum of the digits of 694 is 19
The sum of the digits of 710 is 8
The sum of the digits of 749 is 20
The sum of the digits of 781 is 16
The sum of the digits of 797 is 23
The sum of the digits of 850 is 13
The sum of the digits of 994 is 22
