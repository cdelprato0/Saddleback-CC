*  The Output of this program will display the testing of using a wrapper*
*  class. The Queue class is the wrapper for the Deque class. The first  *
*  part of the output will check to see if the Queue is empty or not.    *
*  After that then it will add the first two elements to the queue and   *
*  will output to the console the contents of the elements. Then it will *
*  return the size of the Queue. It will show the head of the queue by   *
*  the Peek method. The program will dequeue one element off the queue   *
*  and will output what is getting removed. It will test the isEmpty     *
*  method again and output so. After that it will add the last two       *
*  elements to the queue. Finally it will display all of the elements of *
*  the linked list.                                                      *
*  PART TWO -                                                            *
*  The output of the second part of the assignment will be displaying how*
*  an extendable array is used in a circular fashion. The user will be   *
*  prompt with how big of a capacity the user wants to make the array.   *
*  Then the program will provide a menu with options to add, delete, and *
*  display the size and capacity and also the contents inside the array. *
*  The output will read in the first string and then will display. After *
*  it will add another string and show that the capacity has been filled *
*  and will output so. Then it will add a couple of more string and then *
*  it will perform a delete from the front and output. After deleting    *
*  the program will add another string to the array and output.          *
